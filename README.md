## âœ¨ Features

This app is a modification of the excellent open-source project, **Seal**. I focused on simplifying the user experience and customizing the UI.

* **Simplified UI:** Removed advanced and non-essential features to create a straightforward "paste and download" experience.
* **Rebranded:** The app has been renamed to ReelPocket with a custom icon and color scheme.
* **Robust Defaults:** Downloads are now defaulted to universally compatible formats (`.mp4` for video and `.m4a` for audio).
* **Core Functionality:**
    * Download videos from any link supported by `yt-dlp`.
    * Download audio-only from any video link.
    * All downloads are saved directly to the device's public `Downloads` folder.

## ðŸ“„ Credits and License

This project would not be possible without the original **Seal** app.

* **Original Project:** [Seal by JunkFood02](https://github.com/JunkFood02/Seal)
* **License:** This project is a derivative of Seal and is therefore also licensed under the **GPL-3.0 License**. The original license and credit information have been preserved within the app.

This version was modified by **[Your Name Here]**.
